# ANES (2020) Fauci Model

Overview:
This is a model explaining affect toward Anthony Fauci, i.e., his ratings on the “feeling thermometer” (FauciFT) before and after the 2020 Presidential election, using an excerpt from the 2020 American National Election Survey (ANES). The model itself is primarily guided by my theoretical ideas about the relationships between affect toward Fauci, being, partisan identification, ideology, and other variables. There is a small research report attached serving as an analysis of my models findings.

How to engage:

There are four main files:

1. The data file: ANES2020coded.csv \
2. The data codebook: ANESCodebook2022.xlsx \
3. The primary Rmd file: FauciModel.Rmd \
4. A short analysis: Fauci_Model_Analysis.pdf

Additional notes on the ANES 2020 data:


The variables are connected to the ANES survey in the data dictionary and the codebook for the survey is in the associated PDF. The variables have been recoded for direction and scaled
to facilitate meaningful interpretations of the coefficients You can find details of the study and a full version of the codebook at: https://electionstudies.org/project/2020-time-series-study. The ANES study interviewed respondents in a pre-election survey that was conducted between August 18, 2020 and November 3, 2020. Election day was November 3, 2020. The study re-interviewed as many as possible of the same respondents in a post-election survey that was conducted between November 8, 2020 and January 4, 2021.
